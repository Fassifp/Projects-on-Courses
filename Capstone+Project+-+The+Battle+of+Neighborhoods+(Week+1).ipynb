    "The real estate company 'NEWPLACE', very well known in New York, intends to expand its services to the Manhattan area. The problem is that it is an extremely competitive area, and that the company has no knowledge about the neighborhoods, prices and the characteristics of the properties and in which locations they must act to reach a good target audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "They then decided to turn to data science in order to understand more about Manhattan, and make their investment in expansion much safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company also made it clear that, if it were possible, it would like to use these analyzes for other areas, thus changing only the database / city they are looking for to generate another area knowledge report."
